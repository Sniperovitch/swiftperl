*swiftperl* is designed to provide an easy and smooth interoperability between Swift and Perl languages.
The primary goal is to write XS modules for Perl entirely in Swift,
though running Perl Interpreter in Swift environment is also possible.

## Prerequisites

* Swift 3.0 Release
* Perl 5 (>=5.10)

## Getting Started

```sh
swift test -Xcc -D_GNU_SOURCE
```
